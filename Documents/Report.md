## Introduction
In this assignment We are expected to show our knowledge that we have received through this unit by applying software testing, modularity, version control and ethics. We are meant to use Version Control to maintain the all the code and other files. We are meant to create a simple software using modularity principles and test the software using black box and white box testing.
In this Assignment we need to create softwares which can perform different forms of conversions such as string conversions and conversions of measurements such as time. We are required to cover all of category 1 which includes changing a string to upper case or lower case, identifing whether there is a number is a given string, also identify whether a give string is a valid number and we need to create a software to remove numbers from a string and change the string to upper or lower case. For Category 2 we are suppose to choose one Program that we would like to create. Therefore I have choosen to Convert a number which represents a time given in hours to minutes and vice versa, and time given in minutes to seconds and vice versa. For all these different Programs I have choosen to ask the User if they would like to readin a file or type in a string. All data is printed and is also written into a file.
