        Description: This Module Prints out what the code is meant to do and then Runs Module ReadInFileMenu.
        Export: Nothing

        Module: ReadInFileMenu
        Inputs: outputFileName(String) is passed through the Main module
        Description: This Module is used to ask the User if they want to Read in a file or they want to input a string.
                        If yes the system asks the user to input the file name.
                        Then CaseMenu is ran through.
        Export: Nothing

        Module: CaseMenu
        Inputs: inputStatus(String), inputFileName(String), outputFileName(String) is passed through the ReadInFileMenu module
        Description: This Module is used to ask the user if they want to change the string to upper case or lower case.
                        Once the user inputs a valid input the Module runs according to the inputStatus(reading file is yes or no).
                        If reading file is yes then it runs the ReadFile Module, but if it is no the Module asks the user to input the string they want to change the case of.

        Exports: fileInput(String)

        Module: WriteToFile
        Inputs: outputFileName(String), finalString(String) is passed in from Modules Upper or Lower
        Description: This Module is used to Write out the results to the results file.
        Exports: Nothing

        Module: Upper
        Inputs: outputFileName(String), inputString(String) is passed in through the CaseMenu Module
        Description: This Module is used to turn the String to Upper case and then send the finalString to the WriteToFile Module.
        Exports: Nothing

        Module: Lower
        Inputs: outputFileName(String), inputString(String) is passed in through the CaseMenu Module
        Description: This Module is used to turn the String to Lower case and then send the finalString to the WriteToFile Module.
        Exports: Nothing

    (b): Identify whether numeric values are in a give string
	Module: Main
        Inputs: Nothing
        Description: This Module Prints out what the code is meant to do and then Runs Module ReadInFileMenu.
        Export: Nothing

        Module: ReadInFileMenu
        Inputs: outputFileName(String) is passed through the Main module
        Description: This Module is used to ask the User if they want to Read in a file or they want to input a string.
                        If yes the system asks the user to input the file name. Then ReadFile Module is ran through.
        Export: Nothing

        Module: NoMenu
        Inputs: outputFileName(String) is passed in through the ReadInFileMenu Module
        Description: This Module is used to Ask the User to input a string to identify if it has a number in it or not.
                        Used only if User says no in the ReadInFileMenu Module.
                        Once the User inputs a String the CheckForNum Module is ran.
                        The finalString is sent to be written to the output file through WriteToFile Module.
        Exports: Nothing

        Module: ReadFile
        Inputs: inputFileName(String), outputFileName(String) are passed in through ReadInFileMenu Module
        Description: This Module is used to read in the file that the user tells the system to read in ReadInFileMenu Module.
                        The Module runs CheckForNum Module For each line and stores the result as finalString.
                        At the End the of the Module the finalString is sent to be written in to the output file through WriteToFile Module.
        Exports: Nothing
