        Export: Nothing

        Module: ReadInFileMenu
        Inputs: outputFileName(String) is passed through the Main module
        Description: This Module is used to ask the User if they want to Read in a file or they want to input a string.
                        If yes the system asks the user to input the file name.
                        Then CaseMenu is ran through.
        Export: Nothing

        Module: CaseMenu
        Inputs: inputStatus(String), inputFileName(String), outputFileName(String) is passed through the ReadInFileMenu module
        Description: This Module is used to ask the user if they want to change the string to upper case or lower case.
                        Once the user inputs a valid input the Module runs according to the inputStatus(reading file is yes or no).
                        If reading file is yes then it runs the ReadFile Module, but if it is no the Module asks the user to input the string they want to change the case of.
                        Once this is done the Final String is sent to the Upper or Lower Modules depending on User request.

        Description: This Module is used to Write out the results to the results file.
        Exports: Nothing

        Module: Upper
        Inputs: outputFileName(String), inputString(String) is passed in through the CaseMenu Module
        Description: This Module is used to turn the String to Upper case and then send the finalString to the WriteToFile Module.
        Exports: Nothing

        Module: Lower
        Inputs: outputFileName(String), inputString(String) is passed in through the CaseMenu Module
        Description: This Module is used to turn the String to Lower case and then send the finalString to the WriteToFile Module.
        Exports: Nothing
